# Customer Churn Prediction Analysis
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BebishaC/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/customer_churn_Prediction.ipynb)
A machine learning project for predicting customer churn using Random Forest Classifier with SMOTE for handling class imbalance.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data to predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the service). It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model training with evaluation metrics.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- **Model Training**: Random Forest Classifier with balanced class weights
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying key factors affecting churn

## Dataset
**Source**: Kaggle - Customer Churn Dataset  
**Files Used**:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset
**Features**:
- Customer demographics
- Usage patterns
- Account information
- Service details

**Target Variable**: `Churn` (Binary: 0 = Stay, 1 = Leave)
